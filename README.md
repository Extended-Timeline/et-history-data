# et-history-data

**et-history-data** is a version-controlled archive of structured historical data in **YAML format** for the *Extended Timeline (ET)* mod. This project is designed to support the transition of ET to *Europa Universalis V (EU5)* by making the historical game content modular, readable, and easy to convert using automation tools.

Each file represents the historical evolution of a province or region over time through date-stamped entries. This format allows for fine-grained control and easier collaboration on historical accuracy.

## ðŸ§­ Goals

- Represent dynamic historical data (ownership, population, buildings, etc.) in a consistent, flexible format
- Provide clean, machine-readable source data for EU5 modding tools
- Enable collaborative modding through Git-based workflows
