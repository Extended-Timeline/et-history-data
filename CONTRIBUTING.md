# 🧭 Contributing Guide

Welcome! 👋  
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Extended Timeline History Data** project.  
This guide explains, step by step, how to contribute — even if you’ve never used Git or GitHub before.  
No coding experience required!

## 🧩 What’s a Fork?

A **fork** is your own copy of the project.  
Think of it like making a duplicate of a shared document so you can edit it freely without changing the original.

- You fork the main project to your own GitHub account.  
- You make your edits in your fork.  
- When you’re ready, you ask us to pull your changes back into the main project (that’s called a **pull request**).

---

## 🔁 What’s a Pull Request?

A **pull request (PR)** is a way to tell us:

> “Hey, I made some improvements — could you review and add them to the main project?”

It lets the project maintainers review, discuss, and merge your edits into the main repository.

## 🪜 Step-by-Step: How to Contribute

### 1️⃣ Create a GitHub Account
Go to [github.com](https://github.com/login) and sign up — it’s free.

---

### 2️⃣ Go to Our Repository
Open our project link:  
👉 **https://github.com/et-history-data**

---

### 3️⃣ Fork the Repository
In the top-right corner, click **“Fork”**.  
GitHub will create **your own copy** under your account, for example:  
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/et-history-data`

---

### 4️⃣ Edit Files in Your Fork
You can edit files directly in your web browser or make the edits on your PC using git or GitHub Desktop:

1. Open a file (for example, a history data file).  
2. Click the ✏️ **“Edit”** button at the top.  
3. Make your changes (add, fix, or improve data).  
4. At the bottom, add a short message describing your edit (for example, “Added population data for France, 1820”).  
5. Click **“Commit changes”** to save.

---

### 5️⃣ Create a Pull Request
After you’ve made one or more commits:

1. Go back to your fork’s main page.  
2. Click **“Pull requests”** → **“New pull request”**.  
3. GitHub will ask if you want to compare your fork to the main project — click **“Create pull request”**.  
4. Add a short description of what you changed and why.  
5. Click **“Create pull request”** again to submit it.

We’ll get a notification and review your contribution. 🎉

---

### 6️⃣ Wait for Review
The maintainers will:
- Review your proposed changes  
- Possibly suggest small fixes  
- Then **merge** your edits into the main project

Once merged, your contribution becomes part of the shared history data!

## 💬 Tips
- You can do everything in your web browser — no need to install anything.  
- Make small, focused edits (e.g. fix country or area per pull request).  
- **Always** include a short description of what you changed and why.  
- Be patient — maintainers may need time to review your PR.  

---

## 💡 Example
Let’s say you want to add new population data for a country:

1. Fork the repo  
2. Edit the files (e.g. `map_data/europe/western_europe/france_region/anjou_area/le_mans.yml`)
3. Add your data  
4. Save (commit)  
5. Open a pull request titled:  
   **“Add Le Mans population data for 1820”** and cite your sources in the pull request description.

✅ Done!
